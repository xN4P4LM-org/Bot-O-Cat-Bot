# Contributing to Bot-O-Cat

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Bot-O-Cat! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve our project. Before you get started, please take a moment to review the guidelines below.

## Development Environment

To ensure a consistent development environment, we highly recommend using the included devcontainer for development. The devcontainer provides a pre-configured development environment with all the necessary dependencies and tools.

To use the devcontainer, follow these steps:

1. Fork the Bot-O-Cat repository to your own GitHub account.
1. Install Docker on your machine if you haven't already.
1. Clone the Bot-O-Cat repository to your local machine.
1. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
1. If prompted, allow the editor to reopen the project in a container.
1. Wait for the devcontainer to build and start.

By using the devcontainer, you can avoid issues related to different development environments and ensure that your contributions are consistent with the project's standards.

The offically supported code editor is **Visual Studio Code**. If you are using another code editor, you may need to install additional extensions or tools to use the devcontainer and may encounter issues.
